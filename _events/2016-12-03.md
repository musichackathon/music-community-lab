Saturday, December 3rd, 2016 from Noon to 10pm, Monthly Music Hackathon NYC presents the Music With A Purpose Hackathon. Talks, workshops, and several hours dedicated to working on projects together, all focused on understanding music’s role and power in our lives, and how we can use music to improve the lives of others. The day will start with talks giving three perspectives on the theme of Music With A Purpose:

# Music for Social Change

- Maria Damus: Songs of the Black Lives Matter movement

- Martin Urbach: [Youth using music in social justice activism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPg_DwDJZmw)

# Music & Medicine

- Joanne Loewy, director of the [Louis Armstrong Center for Music and Medicine](http://www.musicandmedicine.org/) at Mount Sinai and Associate Professor at Icahn School of Medicine

  Our body is a symphony of sounds – a phenomenal machine with neurologic, respiratory, gastro, and cardiac functions integrating in tandem as fueled by our thoughts, emotions, beliefs, and motivation. Music medicine, and music therapy clinical practice and research has provided fascinating clues and cues that have enlightened our capacity to use music – from disease to wellness, from the womb to hospice. I will present some of music therapy’s most significant findings and show you ways we can use music to enhance health and incentive.

- [Kristin Olson](http://www.kristinoboe.com/), oboist and co-founder of [Mount Sinai Concerts](http://mountsinaiconcerts.org/), will talk about her experience of music while in the hospital and how it inspired her to bring concerts to patients, families, and hospital staff.

# The Functions of Music in Everyday Life

- Amy Belfi, Cognitive Neuroscientist

  Music makes us feel – whether giving us chills down our spine or moving us to tears, the ability of music to evoke strong emotions is intuitively apparent. One of the most powerful and meaningful responses we have to music occurs when a song transports us back to a moment from our lives. In my research, I examine such positive effects of music, including its ability to evoke emotions and memories, in healthy adults and in individuals with brain damage. Through this work I aim to understand why music is such a powerful way to evoke some of our strongest emotional responses.
