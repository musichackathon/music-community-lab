# Schedule

- Noon–12:30 PM

  Special guest students and faculty of NYC-area universities’ music and music-tech programs will talk about projects they are working on.

- 12:30 PM–8:00 PM

  “Hack” on any music-related project of your choice.

  This is an opportunity to intensively workshop an idea, either collaboratively or on your own, and attempt to rapidly take it through the entire lifecycle of a project, from idea to implementation to presentation. Learn about other participants’ projects and get feedback on your project from folks who are also interested in deeply investigating music, but who might have different backgrounds. All levels of skill and experience in any discipline are welcome. Bring an instrument or computer or whatever you think you’ll need to make your hack or contribute to a collaboration.

- 8:00 PM

  Concert and demonstration of the hacks made, plus performances from special guests. Open to everyone.
