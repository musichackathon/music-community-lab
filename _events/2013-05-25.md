# Schedule

- Noon: Hacking starts
- 1pm: Participants’ discussion
- 8pm: Concert and presentations of what we come up with

# Details

This month will be mostly free form (no theme, no speakers, work on whatever you like).

At 1pm let’s plan to have informal discussions of:

1. last month’s Jazz & Technology Forum
2. everybody’s project ideas for this month
3. next month’s HAMR: Hacking Music and Audio Research

It’d be great if we could continue working on projects from last month, and get started brainstorming and preparing for next month.
