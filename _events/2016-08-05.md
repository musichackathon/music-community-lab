# Details

[Monthly Music Hackathon]({{site.baseurl}}{% link about.md %}) and [HAMR: Hacking Audio and Music](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/hamr/ 'HAMR') are teaming up to host the Science of Music Hackathon! This hackathon will focus on ways to combine science and music, using experimentation, technology, or engineering to find out why music is music. Whatever your background or experience, come spend the weekend making music more scientific and science more musical! The event will include talks by music and audio scientists, tutorials by technology-makers, and as usual will conclude with a presentation and concert of hacks. This hackathon is being held in conjunction with the [17th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference](https://wp.nyu.edu/ismir2016/ 'ISMIR 2016') in hopes of enabling collaborations between conference attendees and diverse music communities in New York City.

Also, you’re invited to the [ISMIR-16 conference](https://wp.nyu.edu/ismir2016/ 'ISMIR 2016') (Music Information Retrieval), which will be held in New York City between August 7th and 11th, 2016, primarily at the campus of New York University (NYU). The [scientific program](https://wp.nyu.edu/ismir2016/event/proceedings/ 'ISMIR 2016 Proceedings') consists of a wide array of music tech applications, and may be of interest to attendees of Monthly Music Hackathon. To register for the conference and tutorials, please visit: [https://wp.nyu.edu/ismir2016/participants-2/registration/](https://wp.nyu.edu/ismir2016/participants-2/registration/ 'ISMIR 2015 Registration'). Of particular note to those new to (or curious about) the MIR field might want to check out the tutorial: Music Information Retrieval: Overview, Recent Developments and Future Challenges, participate in the conference’s Science of Music Hackathon, or attend our late breaking/demo session. Participation in these events do not require full registration to the main conference.
