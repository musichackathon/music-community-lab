At Monthly Music Hackathon NYC, musicians, programmers, artists, scientists, composers, hardware tinkerers, and others spend the last Saturday of each month hacking together projects exploring the possibilities of art with sound. At 8pm we have a concert and presentations of the art and tech made that day.

Participants should either bring an idea and whatever they need to complete it (computers, instruments, amps, mics, audio interfaces, electronics parts, glue, etc), and/or proactively coordinate with other participants via our Twitter or Facebook.
