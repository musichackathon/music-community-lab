# Schedule

- Noon–9:00 PM

  Arrive and start hacking! Lunch will be served. The goal of this 9 hour session is for each person or team to claim a location in Spotify’s cafeteria, stage, kitchen, ping pong area, or terrace and turn it into a spooky sound art installation intended to be experienced as a haunted house. See here and here for some photos of last year’s Haunted Hackathon at Control Group in the Woolworth Building. There will be an optional brainstorming session right at Noon SHARP!

- 9:00 PM

  Reception / gallery opening / haunted house. Open to the public. Experience immersive spooky sound art. Meet the artists.
