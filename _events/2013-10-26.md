# Description
On Saturday, October 26th, dozens of artists, engineers, musicians, scientists, and others will spend all day building unique sound art installations in the historic Woolworth Building in lower Manhattan. It’s just before Halloween, and the Woolworth Building is creepy, so it’ll likely be haunted.

Come experience immersive art and technology installations in this unusual gothic environment!

If you’d like to hack together your own sound installation, see the schedule and RSVP [here]().
