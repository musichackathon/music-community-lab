# Schedule

- Noon–12:30 PM

  Special guest composers and instrument builders will give brief informal talks about new musical instrument projects.

- 12:30 PM–8:00 PM

  “Hack” on any music-related project of your choice.

  This is an opportunity to intensively workshop an idea, either collaboratively or on your own, and rapidly take it through the entire lifecycle of a project, from idea to implementation to presentation. Learn about other hackers’ projects and get feedback on your project from folks who are also interested in deeply investigating music, but who might have different backgrounds. All levels of skill and experience in any discipline are welcome.

- 8:00 PM

  Concert and demonstration of the hacks made, plus performances from special guests. Open to everyone.

# Talks

We’re really excited to have as our special guests the composers and engineers behind “New Music For New Instruments”! 

“New Music for New Instruments” is a concert under development that will be presented this November in Brooklyn. The program will feature works created through the collaboration of instrument builders Andy Cavatorta, Merche Blasco, and Nick Yulman working together with composers Angelica Negron, Albert Behar, Fjola Evans and Molly Herron. This collaboration is a conversation about music and the potential of new sounds and new interfaces for engaging dynamic performances created through the dialogue between the composers and instrument builders.
