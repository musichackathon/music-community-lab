# Details
The [Monthly Music Hackathon]({{site.baseurl}}{% link about.md %}) series presents our New Musical Instruments Hackathon:  a day-long, non-competitive, creative event exploring new ways to make music, noise, & sound.  From musical robots to hyperinstruments to making wind instruments out of pipes, we’ve got it all. The event is open to hackers and aspiring hackers of all skill levels and disciplines, utilizing technology or not.

Our presenters include [Thomas Carroll](http://www.carrollclarinet.com/ "Thomas Carroll"), who builds clarinets and historical wind instruments; [Lori Napoleon (Merdian7, Antenes)](http://meridian7.net/ "Lori Napoleon"), who builds modular synths from old telephones switchboards; Scott Barton & Steven Kemper, who make musical robots; [Jessica Segal](http://www.jessicasegall.com/ "Jessica Segal"), who makes music from bees and old pianos; and Matthew Ostrowski, who makes music out of rotary phones.

We’re also planning workshops on new instrument hardware, interactive dance & gestural music. Performance-wise, we’ll have an excerpt of [Jay Allen Zimmerman](http://www.musicbyjaz.com "Jay Allen Zimmerman")’s Roboticus, along with music from the EMMI bots.
