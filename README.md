## Mission

Monthly Music Hackathon (MMH) is hardly your typical hackathon – we create a safe space for anyone to experiment with
any music in a supportive environment. There’s a lot there, so let’s unpack it a bit.

### Music above All

MMH is a celebration of music and creativity. We adopt the concept of “hacking” music from the tech world as an effective
way to approach experimenting with nearly any aspect of art. That said, technology is a means of making and interacting
with music; computers, electronics, and data are just some of the many ways to hack music, as well as remixing or sampling.

### Promote Diversity across Backgrounds, Perspectives, and Abilities

Music is a fundamentally human phenomenon, and MMH welcomes people and music of all walks. There are an infinite number
of approaches to music, and a bewildering variety of them are represented in New York. We believe it is both healthy and
vital to establish common ground with people who have different experiences. What’s more, in addition to being good for
humanity, this also helps foster a greater potential for innovation [see

### Drive Personal Growth through Creation, Collaboration, Communication

The participants decide what to work on and what the events will be like. We help people develop skills, we support newcomers,
kids, and people who are more comfortable learning and creating in a structured environment with hands on mentorship.

### Cultivate a Safe Environment for Innovation and Experimentation

Champion of artists, scientists, and other music hackers who are doing good work but not getting the attention they deserve,
possibly because of discrimination. We do this in part by celebrating diversity of our organizing group, of invited guests,
and of participants.

Provide a platform for underserved communities such as but by no means limited to: music and accessibility; music therapy &
education for the young and old; regional or cultural genres; gender identity in music.

### Independently Operated, Volunteer Organized

MMH is an independent organization managed by volunteers. We are proud of our strong industry relationships and grateful for
their generous support, but MMH operates wholly outside the scope of any corporate entity. Combined with creating a safe
environment, this also means MMH is no place for intellectual property (IP) grabs, explicit advertising or recruiting.

## What it isn’t

MMH strives to be many things, but there are a few notable common misconceptions that we would highlight here.

### Competitive

We do not offer (or allow) prizes. We discourage competitiveness and encourage collaboration, encouragement, and providing
productive feedback.

### Commercial

Whereas other hackathons or similar events provide explicit opportunities for promoting current or prospective business,
this is not the goal.
